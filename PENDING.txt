- Change font-family to roboto and width (maybe use label or paragraph)

- Add the parallax background

- Add Redux stuff. Define state tree, reducers and actions.

- Tests

- Create service or fake api to check ajax calls.

- Define how to show error message to the user.





Things I still don't get


- 12 columns and 10 gutter?

- No specification of which variant of Roboto font to use

- LightBox or Modal for images in the middle?

- Show form with every image?
